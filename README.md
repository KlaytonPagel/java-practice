A repository for practicing and testing Java

- Created a basic Hello World method
- Started my Notes package
  
My notes package is a Java file for examples, explanations and demonstations of different things.
So far I have gone over the primitive data types, string variables, the general useage of variables, and operators.

1/26/2024
- Continued working on Notes package

In the notes file i added the usage conditional statements, switch statements, and loops.

1/27/2024
- Added more to the Notes file
- Started working on my own implementation of a stack

In the Notes file I added Arrays, catch throw statements, and access modifiers.
I started using methods and moved each section into their own method.
I created a second class to begin working on OOP programming.

I started making my own version of an array based stack data structure.
So far my Stack class has methods for pushing, poping, getting the length, increasing the size. 
I overloaded the push method so the user can push different variable types.
Still working on making the stack return different vaiable types when popped.

- Added a few notes
- Altered the Stack class
- created a Calculator

Couldn't figure out a way to have the stack return different variable types.
I determined it was unessisary and I could convert it when needed when the stack is actually used.

I added a section to the notes for user input and the "and" and "or" operator types.

Created a new class for a calculator. the calculator takes one input per line and calculates as the user inputs.
I use different methods to verify the users inputs are valid and have them enter a new input if not.

1/29/2024
- Started password checker
- started spring boot

I started a password checker class, The idea is to take an inputted string and see if it meets your password requirements.

I started the basics of a spring boot API. I was able to create a basic hello world program.
