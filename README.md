A repository for practicing and testing Java

- Created a basic Hello World method
- Started my Notes package
  
My notes package is a Java file for examples, explanations and demonstations of different things.
So far I have gone over the primitive data types, string variables, the general useage of variables, and operators.

- Continued working on Notes package

In the notes file i added the usage conditional statements, switch statements, and loops.

1/27/2024
- Added more to the Notes file
- Started working on my own implementation of a stack

In the Notes file I added Arrays, catch throw statements, and access modifiers.
I started using methods and moved each section into their own method.
I created a second class to begin working on OOP programming.

I started making my own version of an array based stack data structure.
So far my Stack class has methods for pushing, poping, getting the length, increasing the size. 
I overloaded the push method so the user can push different variable types.
Still working on making the stack return different vaiable types when popped.
